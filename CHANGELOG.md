All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.10.0]

- upgraded to LSP 5.3.0 and Monaco 0.17.0

### Breaking changes

Switch to es6 from es5. For clients who cannot migrate to es6 please use babel to transpile Monaco and LSP to es5.
  - to configure babel wit webpack:
```js
    {
        test: /\\.js$/,
        // include only es6 dependencies to transpile them to es5 classes
        include: /monaco-languageclient|vscode-ws-jsonrpc|vscode-jsonrpc|vscode-languageserver-protocol|vscode-languageserver-types|vscode-languageclient/,
        use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
                presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
                plugins: [
                    // reuse runtime babel lib instead of generating it in each js file
                    '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime',
                    // ensure that classes are transpiled
                    '@babel/plugin-transform-classes'
                ],
                // see https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8900#issuecomment-431240426
                sourceType: 'unambiguous',
                cacheDirectory: true
            }
        }
    }
```

## [0.9.0] - 2018-09.06

- use monaco-editor-core as a dev dependency to allow alternative implementations [#119](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/119)

### Breaking changes

Clients have to explicitly declare a dependency to `monaco-editor-core` or another package providing Monaco:
- `monaco-editor-core` is tree shaked to get rid of unused VS Code's code.
- [@typefox/monaco-editor-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typefox/monaco-editor-core) is a not tree-shaked alternative.

## [0.8.0] - 2018-09-04

## [0.7.0] - 2018-07-31
Updated to `vscode-languageclient` 4.4.0 to support LSP 3.10.0 features like hierarchical document symbols, go to type defition/implementation, workspace folders and document color provider ([#89](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/89)).

### Breaking changes

In order to use `vscode-languageclient` directly the compatibility layer was implemented for subset of `vscode` APIs used by the client:

- `vscode-compatibility` should be used as an implementation of `vscode` module at the runtime
  - to adjust module resolution with `webpack`:
  ```js
      resolve: {
          alias: {
              'vscode': require.resolve('monaco-languageclient/lib/vscode-compatibility')
          }
      }
  ```
  - `register-vscode` should be required once to adjust module resolution with `Node.js`, for example to stub `vscode` APIs for Mocha tests:
  ```
  --require monaco-languageclient/lib/register-vscode
  ```
- `MonacoLanguageClient` should be used instead of `BaseLanguageClient`
- `MonacoServices` should be installed globally to be accessible for `vscode-compatibility` module, not per a language client
  - for the use case with a single standalone editor:
  ```ts
  import { MonacoServices } from 'monaco-languageclient';

  MonacoServices.install(editor);
  ```
  - to support sophisticated use cases one can install custom Monaco services:
  ```ts
  import { MonacoServices, Services } from 'monaco-languageclient';

  const services: MonacoServices = {
      worspace, languages, commands, window
  };
  Services.install(services);
  ```

- convert `monaco.MarkerSeverity.Hint` values to `DiagnosticSeverity.Hint` ([#71](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/71))

## [0.4.0] - 2018-02-13
- add support for `textDocument/documentLink` and `documentLink/resolve` ([#53](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/issues/53))

- state that versioned changes are supported in a `WorkspaceEdit` ([#56](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/56))
- replaced `monaco-editor` with `monaco-editor-core` ([#58](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/58))

## [0.3.0] - 2018-02-08
- fix handling of `codeLens/resolve` if no provider exists ([#46](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/46))
- removed `monaco-editor-core` dependency, keeping only `monaco-editor` ([#42](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/issues/42))
