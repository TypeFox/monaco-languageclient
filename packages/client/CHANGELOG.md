## [7.0.1] - 2023-11-10

## [7.0.0] - 2023-11-02

- **BREAKING:** Changed the treemending approach:
  - The postinstall step is removed. `monaco-languageclient` no longer patches an existing `monaco-editor` instead the package `@codingame/monaco-editor-treemended` is used. This requires that projects using this lib to enforce the correct `monaco-editor` with overrides (npm/pnpm) or resolutions (yarn) in the `package.json`.

It is replaced by `initServices` that makes configration of services exposed by `monaco-vscode-api` handy and still allows the definition of own services as [outlined here](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#monaco-standalone-services) and these can be passed as `userServices` in `initServices`.
- Most client examples now share [common code](./packages/examples/main/src/common.ts) to reduce the amount of redundant code.

  - More services from `monaco-vscode-api` are used in the langium example (language config, text mate, keyboard bindings)
  - Updates to `monaco-editor` version `0.36.1` and vscode api compatibility to `1.76.0`
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Do not reexport code of imported libraries (e.g. vscode-languageclient) [#459](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/459)
  - Content of `vscode-jsonrpc`,`vscode-languageclient` and `vscode-languageserver-protocol` is no longer re-exported

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: All cjs exports have been removed.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The old `monaco-converter` has been removed. If you still rely on it, please take a look at the example [language service written in JavaScript](../examples/browser/src/client.ts) and adapt to the converters usage available since v2.0.0.
- Added verification examples for webpack and vite that shall ensure the libs work in dependent projects and the give you an idea how to use `monaco-languageclient` and `vscode-ws-jsonrpc` with common bundlers.
- Revised all READMEs

## [3.0.1] - 2022-08-24

- Update `monaco-vscode-api` to version `1.69.9`

## [3.0.0] - 2022-08-15

- Update to monaco 0.34/vscode 1.69 [#409](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/409)

## 2.x.x BREAKING CHANGES

v2+ of this library is dependant on [monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api) which removed all vscode-api/-compatibility related code. The change has mostly no effect on end users code, but there are two things that need to be taken into account:

- If you use Webpack or vite for bundling, you have to remove the `vscode` alias entry from the configuration
- If you customized monaco services, then you have to adjust them to the changed interface

- `MonacoServices` now takes the `monaco` object instead of the `CommandRegistry`

before:

```typescript
MonacoServices.install(require('monaco-editor-core/esm/vs/platform/commands/common/commands').CommandsRegistry);
```

after:

```typescript
import - as monaco from 'monaco-editor-core'

MonacoServices.install(monaco);
```

- `MonacoServices` should now be installed using the command registry instead of the editor

before:

```typescript
const editor = monaco.editor.create(...);
MonacoServices.install(editor);
```

after:

```typescript
MonacoServices.install(require('monaco-editor-core/esm/vs/platform/commands/common/commands').CommandsRegistry);
```

## [0.13.0] - 2020-04-06

- Upgraded to vscode-uri 2.x [741a3df](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/commit/741a3dfb865eff55c3dcc4a51f74759921d3f2a5)

### Breaking changes

Switch to es6 from es5. For clients who cannot migrate to es6 please use babel to transpile Monaco and LSP to es5.

- to configure babel wit webpack:

```js
    {
        test: /\\.js$/,
        // include only es6 dependencies to transpile them to es5 classes
        include: /monaco-languageclient|monaco-jsonrpc|vscode-jsonrpc|vscode-languageserver-protocol|vscode-languageserver-types|vscode-languageclient/,
        use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
                presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
                plugins: [
                    // reuse runtime babel lib instead of generating it in each js file
                    '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime',
                    // ensure that classes are transpiled
                    '@babel/plugin-transform-classes'
                ],
                // see https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8900#issuecomment-431240426
                sourceType: 'unambiguous',
                cacheDirectory: true
            }
        }
    }
```

## [0.9.0] - 2018-09-06

- use monaco-editor-core as a dev dependency to allow alternative implementations [#119](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/119)

### Breaking changes

Clients have to explicitly declare a dependency to `monaco-editor-core` or another package providing Monaco:

- `monaco-editor-core` is tree shaked to get rid of unused VS Code's code.
- [@typefox/monaco-editor-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typefox/monaco-editor-core) is a not tree-shaked alternative.

## [0.8.0] - 2018-09-04

- updated dependency to Monaco 0.14.x, with adaptation for breaking changes from monaco [#107](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/107) - thanks to [@Twinside](https://github.com/Twinside)
- ensure that SignatureHelp and SignatureHelp has non-null arrays [#112](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/112) - thanks to [@rcjsuen](https://github.com/rcjsuen)

## [0.7.3] - 2018-08-30

- fixed folding ranges conversion - [12d8c91](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/commit/12d8c91cf1676061c44d43e745b7500c77ea4a14)
- implement `toJSON` for workspace configurations - [9e50a48](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/commit/9e50a48addb474be66fa317684461976eda45192)
- fixed markdown conversion [#103](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/103)

## [0.7.2] - 2018-08-02

- amd distribution ([#97](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/97)) - thanks to [@zewa666](https://github.com/zewa666)
- updated dependency to Monaco 0.13.2 ([#100](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/100))
- register providers only for languages matching the documentSelector ([#101](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/101)) - thanks to [@gins3000](https://github.com/gins3000)

## [0.7.0] - 2018-07-31

Updated to `vscode-languageclient` 4.4.0 to support LSP 3.10.0 features like hierarchical document symbols, go to type defition/implementation, workspace folders and document color provider ([#89](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/89)).

### Breaking changes

In order to use `vscode-languageclient` directly the compatibility layer was implemented for subset of `vscode` APIs used by the client:

- `vscode-compatibility` should be used as an implementation of `vscode` module at the runtime
  - to adjust module resolution with `webpack`:

  ```js
      resolve: {
          alias: {
              'vscode': require.resolve('monaco-languageclient/lib/vscode-compatibility')
          }
      }
  ```

  - `register-vscode` should be required once to adjust module resolution with `Node.js`, for example to stub `vscode` APIs for Mocha tests:

  ```
  --require monaco-languageclient/lib/register-vscode
  ```

- `MonacoLanguageClient` should be used instead of `BaseLanguageClient`
- `MonacoServices` should be installed globally to be accessible for `vscode-compatibility` module, not per a language client
  - for the use case with a single standalone editor:

  ```ts
  import { MonacoServices } from 'monaco-languageclient';

  MonacoServices.install(editor);
  ```

  - to support sophisticated use cases one can install custom Monaco services:

  ```ts
  import { MonacoServices, Services } from 'monaco-languageclient';

  const services: MonacoServices = {
      worspace, languages, commands, window
  };
  Services.install(services);
  ```

## [0.6.0] - 2018-04-18

- updated dependency to Monaco 0.12 ([#70](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/70))
- support `CompletionItem`'s `additionalTextEdits` property ([#39](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/issues/39))
- convert `monaco.MarkerSeverity.Hint` values to `DiagnosticSeverity.Hint` ([#71](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/71))

## [0.4.0] - 2018-02-13

- add support for `textDocument/documentLink` and `documentLink/resolve` ([#53](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/issues/53))
- state that `workspace/applyEdit` is supported in the capabilities ([#55](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/55))
- state that versioned changes are supported in a `WorkspaceEdit` ([#56](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/pull/56))
