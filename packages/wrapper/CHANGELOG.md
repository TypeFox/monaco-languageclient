  - The `languageId` is automatically derived from the uri, but can also be optionally enforced
- BREAKING: changes to `MonacoEditorLanguageClientWrapper`:
  - `updateCodeResources` or `updateEditorModels` allow to update the text content or editor model
- Internal code handling model and text updates has been reworked. Different code paths for regualr and diff editors have been unified.

- Updated to `monaco-languageclient` `6.1.0` using `monaco-vscode-api` `1.79.1` and `monaco-editor` `0.38.0`

## [2.0.0] - 2023-06-02

- Move away from "property" based configuration. `UserConfig` drives the complete monaco-editor configuration
  - Use global configuration object that is passed to the wrapper on start
  - The `monaco-editor-wrapper` and the new `@typefox/monaco-editor-react` component use the same configuration
- The underlying monaco-editor can be configured in two ways now (wrapperConfig):
  - Classic: As before, but with one config object
  - Extension like: Using the extension based mechanism supplied by `monaco-vscode-api`
- `monaco-languageclient` no longer exposes its own service. Now, we fully rely on services supplied by `monaco-vscode-api`
  - This means even if you decide to configure monaco-editor the classical way, you still require some basic services. This configuration is made inside `MonacoEditorLanguageClientWrapper`. Potential serviceConfig supplied when using vscode-api extension config is taken into account and combined then.
- Re-configuration without full editor restart:
  - Updating the text model(s) is possible
  - Updating the monaco-editor options is possible
  - Restarting the languageclient is possible independently
- Everything else requires a restart of the editor!

- Bundling issues with imported workers from wrapper #[14](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-components/issues/14)

    - `monaco-editor-wrapper/allLanguages`
    - `monaco-editor-wrapper/bundle`
    - `monaco-editor-wrapper/bundle/allLanguages`

## [1.2.0] - 2022-09-22

- It is now possible to configure and use a full language extension configuration

  - `getMonaco()`
  - `getEditor()`

  - `getLanguageClient()`
  - `getMainCode()`
  - `getDiffCode()`

## [1.0.0] - 2022-09-08
