## Getting started

On your local machine you can prepare your dev environment as follows. At first it is advised to build everything. Or, use a fresh dev environment in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) by pressing the **code now** badge above.
Locally, from a terminal do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient.git
cd monaco-languageclient
npm i
# Cleans-up, compiles and builds everything
npm run build
```

### Vite dev server

Start the Vite dev server. It serves all client code at [localhost](http://localhost:8080). You can go to the [index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html) and navigate to all client examples from there. You can edit the client example code directly (TypeScript) and Vite ensures it automatically made available:

```shell
npm run dev
```

As this is a npm workspace the main [package.json](./package.json) contains script entries applicable to the whole workspace like `watch`, `build` and `lint`, but it also contains shortcuts for launching scripts from the childe packages like `npm run build:examples`.

If you want to change the libries and see this reflected directly, then you need to run the watch command that compiles all TypeScript files form both libraries and the examples:

```shell
npm run watch
```

## Using monaco-languageclient

### NEW with v7: Treemended monaco-editor

Since version 2 (see [Important Project Changes](#important-project-changes)) of this library we rely on [@codingame/monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api) to supply the vscode API. It evolved substantially since then and thesedays allows to use many vscode only services with `monaco-editor`.

Earlier in 2023 we started to treemend an existing `monaco-editor` dependency via a postinstall script. This adds back monaco-editor code that was removed during bundling/threeshaking (*treemending*). See the detailed explanation [here](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#why). But, this introduced multiple problems.

#### Overrides instructions

With v7 we decided to use readily treemended version of monaco-editor called [@codingame/monaco-editor-treemended](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codingame/monaco-editor-treemended), but this requires to add `overrides` (npm/pnmpm) and `resolutions` (yarn) in your project. Setting these ensures that all dependencies to `monaco-editor` and `vscode` are aligned:

```yaml
  "overrides": {
    "monaco-editor": "npm:@codingame/monaco-editor-treemended@>=1.83.12 <1.84.0",
    "vscode": "npm:@codingame/monaco-vscode-api@>=1.83.12 <1.84.0"
  },
  "resolutions": {
    "monaco-editor": "npm:@codingame/monaco-editor-treemended@>=1.83.12 <1.84.0",
    "vscode": "npm:@codingame/monaco-vscode-api@>=1.83.12 <1.84.0"
  }
```

In the following table you can see the effect when using `npm list monaco-editor` (here the [angular client example](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient-ng-example.git) was used to demonstrate it):

| No overrides | With overrides |
| :----         | :----   |
| ![No overrides](./docs/images/no-overrides.png) | ![With overrides](./docs/images/with-overrides.png)  |

With `overrides` or `resolutions` configured any child depndencies with a another `monaco-editor` version will chnaged to the one you enforce.

This means some extra-configuration work, but removes the need for any postinstall scripts which lead to multiple package manager problems. It is now also very clear what is used and needed. Please see [Monaco-editor / @codingame/monaco-vscode-api compatibility table](#monaco-editor--codingamemonaco-vscode-api-compatibility-table) for a complete overview.

### Using services and extra packages from @codingame/monaco-vscode-api

The bespoke projects not only supplies the api, but it provides 100+ packages with additional services, default extensions and language packs. By default when initalizing `monaco-languageclient` via the required `initServices` the following services are always loaded:

- *languages* and model *services* (always added by `monaco-languagclient`)
- *layout*, *environment*, *extension*, *files* and *quickAccess* (always added by `monaco-vscode-api`)

Please check the [following link](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#monaco-standalone-services) for information about all services supplied by [@codingame/monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api).

Please check our examples [in the examples overview chapter](#examples-overview) as they demonstrate the usage (jump-start: [python client](./packages/examples/src/python/client/main.ts) for services and default extension usage or [Langium Statemachine](./packages/examples/src/langium/statemachineClient.ts) / [Locale Loader](./packages/examples/src/langium/localeLoader.ts))

#### textmate and monarch

If you use the `textmate` or `theme` services you are able to load textmate based grammars and theme definitions from vscode:

```js
import getThemeServiceOverride from '@codingame/monaco-vscode-theme-service-override';
import getTextmateServiceOverride from '@codingame/monaco-vscode-textmate-service-override';
```

Once you those services you can no longer make use of monarch based grammars and themes.

## Examples Overview

There are a couple of different examples that demonstrate how the `monaco-languageclient` can be used.

### Main Examples

- [JSON Language client and language server example](./packages/examples/src/json):
  - The **json-server** runs a Node.js [Express app](./packages/examples/src/json/server/main.ts) where web sockets are used to enable communication between the language server process and the client web application. The language server can be started as internal or external process. Use `npm run start:example:server:json` to start the language server (see [Server processes](#server-processes)).

  - The **json-client** contains the [client web app](./packages/examples/src/json/client/main.ts) which connects to the language server therefore requires the node server app to be run in parallel.

- [Python Language client and pyright language server example](./packages/examples/src/python):
  - The **python-server** runs a Node.js [Express app](./packages/examples/src/python/server/main.ts) where web sockets are used to enable communication between the language server process and the client web application. The language server can be started as internal or external process. Use `npm run start:example:server:python` to start the language server (see [Server processes](#server-processes)).

  - The **python-client** contains the [client web app](./packages/examples/src/python/client/main.ts) which connects to the language server therefore requires the node server app to be run in parallel.

- Langium example:
  - Statemachine DSL (created with Langium) **statemachine-web-worker-language-server** example located in [./packages/examples/src/langium](./packages/examples/src/langium) contains both the [language client](./packages/examples/src/langium/statemachineClient.ts) and the [langauge server (web worker)](https://github.com/langium/langium/blob/main/examples/statemachine/src/language-server/main-browser.ts). The web worker example communicate via `vscode-languageserver-protocol/browser` instead of a web socket used in the **JSON examples** examples.

- The **browser** example located in [./packages/examples/src/browser](./packages/examples/src/browser) demonstrates how a [language service written in JavaScript](./packages/examples/src/browser/main.ts) can be used in a Monaco Editor contained in a simple HTML page. This example can now be considered legacy as the web worker option eases client side language server implementation and separation.

- The **react-client** example located in [./packages/examples/src/react](./packages/examples/src/react) contains the [React client](./packages/examples/src/react/main.tsx). It does the same as the regular client example but inside a React Functional Component.

- The **angular-client** example is now found in [its own repository](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient-ng-example.git)

**Important:** Apart from the **json-server** and **python-server** process all other will be server by the [Vite dev server](#vite-dev-server). Some examples share [common code](./packages/examples/src/common.ts) to reduce the amount of redundant code.

### Verification Examples

- The **webpack** verification example located in [./packages/verify/webpack](./packages/verify/webpack) demonstrates how bundling can be achieved with webpack. You find the configuration here: [webpack.config.js](./packages/verify/webpack/webpack.config.js).

- The **vite** verification example located in [./packages/verify/vite](./packages/verify/vite) demonstrates how bundling can be achieved with vite. There is no configuration required.

#### Pure bundler verification

- [./packages/verify/pnpm](./packages/verify/pnpm) is not part of the npm workspace. It allows to test whether `pnpm install` works as expected and it allows to test `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` treemending via `pnpm run test:treemending`.
- [./packages/verify/yarn](./packages/verify/yarn) is not part of the npm workspace. It allows to test whether `yarn install` works as expected and it allows to test `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` treemending via `yarn run test:treemending`.

### Example usage

#### Server processes

For the **json-client** or the **client-webpack** examples you need to ensure the **json-server** example is running:

```shell
# start the express server with the language server running in the same process.
npm run start:example:server:json
```

For the **python-client** example you need to ensure the **paython-server** example is running:

```shell
# start the express server with the language server running in an external node process.
npm run start:example:server:python
```

#### Verification Example Servers

If you want to reach the verification examples from the vite dev server index page you need to run the following additional http-servers beforehand (this is also indicated on the page itself):

```shell
# Serve the webpack verification example on http://localhost:8081
npm run start:verify:webpack
# Serve the vite verification example on http://localhost:8082
npm run start:verify:vite
```

### VSCode integration

You can as well run [vscode tasks](./.vscode/launch.json) to start and debug the server in different modes and the client.

## Troubleshooting

### General

Again, if you use **monaco-languageclient** make sure you define matching [Overrides instructions](#overrides-instructions) in your local project to override any mismatching **monaco-editor** or **vscode** versions with you dependency tree.

Ensure **monaco-editor**, **vscode** and **monaco-languageclient** are imported before you do any **monaco-editor** or vscode-api intialization or start using it. Please check the [our python language client example](./packages/examples/src/python/client/main.ts) to see how it should be done.

### Dependency issues: monaco-editor / @codingame/monaco-editor-treemended

It is recommended to study this chapter first: [NEW with v7: Treemended monaco-editor](#new-with-v7-treemended-monaco-editor).
If you have mutiple, possibly hundreds of compile errors resulting from missing functions deep in `monaco-editor` or `vscode` then it is very likely your `package-lock.json` or `node_modules` are dirty. Remove both and do a fresh `npm install`. Always `npm list monaco-editor` is very useful. If you see different or errornous versions, then this is an indicator something is wrong.

Current observation is: When using npm overrides upgrading them seems to be problematic. Best practices seems to be to remove `package-lock.json` or `node_modules` and do a full re-installation with `npm i` afterwards.

### Volta

There are [Volta](https://volta.sh/) instructions in the `package.json` files. When you have Volta available it will ensure the exactly specified `node` and `npm` versions are used.

### Vite dev server troubleshooting

When you are using vite for development please be aware of [this recommendation](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#if-you-use-vite).

If you see the problem *Assertion failed (There is already an extension with this id)* you likely have mismatching dependencies defined for `monaco-editor` or `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api`. You should fix this or add the following entry to your vite config:

```javascript
resolve: {
  dedupe: ['monaco-editor', 'vscode']
}
```

### Serve all files required

 `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` requires json and other files to be served. In your project's web-server configuration you have to ensure you don't prevent this.

### Bad Polyfills

#### buffer

If you see an error similar to the one below:

```yaml
Uncaught Error: Unexpected non—whitespace character after JSON at position 2

SyntaxError: Unexpected non—whitespace character after JSON at position 2
    at JSON. parse («anonymous>)
```

It is very likely you have an old version of `buffer` interfering (see [#538](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/issues/538) and [#546](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/issues/546)). You can enforce a current version by adding a `resolution` as shown below to your projects' `package.json`.

```yaml
"resolutions": {
  "buffer": "~6.0.3",
}
```

### monaco-editor-core

Originally **monaco-languageclient** was dependent on **monaco-editor-core**, but we changed this with version **1.0.0**. If your project requires to use **monaco-editor-core** and you want to stay compatible with **1.0.0** of **monaco-languageclient** you can install **monaco-editor-core** as **monaco-editor**:

```shell
npm install monaco-editor@npm:monaco-editor-core
```

Or if you are using **Webpack** you can alternatively add this alias to its config:

```javascript
resolve: {
  alias: {
    // This doesn't pull any languages into bundles and works as monaco-editor-core was installed
    'monaco-editor$': 'monaco-editor-core$',
    'monaco-editor/': 'monaco-editor-core/',
  }
}
```

If you use **monaco-editor** as dependency, but only want to have the content of **monaco-editor-core** than just only import:

```javascript
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/edcore.main.js';
```

### @monaco-editor/react

Add the **monaco-editor** import at the top of your editor component file [source](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react#use-monaco-editor-as-an-npm-package):

```javascript
import * as monaco from "monaco-editor";
import { loader } from "@monaco-editor/react";

loader.config({ monaco });
```

### pnpm

If you use pnpm, you have to add `vscode` / `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` as direct dependency (see the [following table](#monaco-editor--codingamemonaco-vscode-api-compatibility-table)), otherwise the installation will fail.

```json
"vscode": "npm:@codingame/monaco-vscode-api@>=1.83.12 <1.84.0"
```

## Monaco-editor / @codingame/monaco-vscode-api compatibility table

The following table describes which version of **monaco-languageclient** and **@codingame/monaco-vscode-api** are compatible with a specific version of **monaco-editor**. The listing starts with version 2.0.0 because **@codingame/monaco-vscode-api** was introduced for the first time.

**Important:** Please see the following table which `monaco-editor` or `@codingame/monaco-editor-treemended` (since v7) versions are required to be used you use the correct monaco-editor version.

## Important Project Changes

### October 2023 (v7.0.0)

Revised the `treemending` approach. The postinstall step is removed. `monaco-languageclient` no longer patches and existing `monaco-editor` instead the package `@codingame/monaco-editor-treemended` is used. This requires that projects using this lib have to enforce the correct editor by overrides (npm/pnpm) or resolutions (yarn) in the `package.json`.

### September 2023 (v6.5.0)

Updated to `monaco-editor` `0.43.0` and `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` `1.82.2`. `initServices` does no longer use dynamic imports. All services available from [@codingame/monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#monaco-standalone-services) or the own service must be passed to `userServices`. All examples have been adapted accordingly.

### May 2023 (v6.0.0)

Updated to `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` `1.78.5` and therefore retired `MonacoServices`. It is replaced by `initServices` that makes configuration of services exposed by `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` handy and still allows the definition of own services as [outlined here](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#monaco-standalone-services) and these can be passed as `userServices` in `initServices`.

### April 2023 (v5.0.0)

Both libraries no longer export code from other libraries (`vscode-jsonrpc`, `vscode-languageclient` and `vscode-languageserver-protocol`).

### September 2022 (v4.0.0)

All code has been transformed to esm and npm packages are now of type module. cjs bundles are no longer available.
The `monaco-converter` has been removed.

### June 2022 (v2.0.0)

[@codingame/monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api) was created by [CGNonofr](https://github.com/CGNonofr) and this library is now based on it and the old [implementation was removed](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#history).

We added the independent **[vscode-ws-jsonrpc](./packages/vscode-ws-jsonrpc)** as sub-package into this repository.

### May 2022 (v1.0.0)

From release 1.0.0 onward the project switched to npm workspaces. We no longer require yarn, lerna and webpack. Mostly therefore the list of `devDependencies` is substantially shorter. All code has been moved to [./packages](./packages) directory.

As before the library code is just compiled with the TypeScript compiler and the library is now packaged with npm. The need for bundling does no longer exist for the example. The compiled code is either executed by node or the web/client related code/pages are served with [vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/). We added a [verification examples](#verification-examples) for the web client example using webpack.

The default and protected branch is now `main`.
