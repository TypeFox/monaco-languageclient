## Latest Important Project Changes

### May 2023 (v6.0.0)

Updated to `monaco-vscode-api` `1.78.5` and therefore retired `MonacoServices`. It is replaced by `initServices` that makes configration of services exposed by `monaco-vscode-api` handy and still allows the definition of own services as [outlined here](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#monaco-standalone-services) and these can be passed as `userServices` in `initServices`.

### April 2023 (v5.0.0)

Both libraries no longer export code from other libraries (`vscode-jsonrpc`, `vscode-languageclient` and `vscode-languageserver-protocol`).

### September 2022 (v4.0.0)

All code has been transformed to esm and npm packages are now of type module. cjs bundles are no longer available.
The `monaco-converter` has been removed.

### June 2022 (v2.0.0)

[monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api) was created by [CGNonofr](https://github.com/CGNonofr) and this library is now based on it and the old [implementation was removed](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#history).

We added the independent **[vscode-ws-jsonrpc](./packages/vscode-ws-jsonrpc)** as sub-package into this repository.

### May 2022 (v1.0.0)

From release 1.0.0 onward the project switched to npm workspaces. We no longer require yarn, lerna and webpack. Mostly therefore the list of `devDependencies` is substantially shorter. All code has been moved to [./packages](./packages) directory.

As before the library code is just compiled with the TypeScript compiler and the library is now packaged with npm. The need for bundling does no longer exist for the example. The compiled code is either executed by node or the web/client related code/pages are served with [vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/). We added a [verification example](#verification) for the web client example using webpack.

The default and protected branch is now `main`.

## Using monaco-languageclient

⚠️ **Starting with version 6.0.0** `monaco-languageclient` runs a postinstall script when you install the dependencies in your project. If you re-run `npm install` this script is not invoked again.

**Why?** This is a change in [monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api) that adds back monaco-editor code that was removed during bundling/threeshaking. See the detailed explanation [here](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api#why).

### Monaco-editor / monaco-vscode-api compatibility table

The following table describes which version of **monaco-languageclient** and **monaco-vscode-api** are compatible with a specific version of **monaco-editor**. The listing starts with version 2.0.0 because **monaco-vscode-api** was introduced for the first time.

**Important:** Due to the `monaco-treemending` mentioned above, it is mandatory you use the correct monaco-editor version. This is defined by peerDependency in [monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api)

## Getting started

### Dev environments

On your local machine you can prepare your dev environment as follows. At first it is advised to build everything. From CLI in root of the project run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient.git
cd monaco-languageclient
npm i
# Cleans-up, compiles and builds everything
npm run build
```

Or, use a fresh dev environment in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) by pressing the **code now** badge above.

### Scripts Overview

The main [package.json](./package.json) contains script entries applicable to the whole workspace like `watch`, `build` and `lint`, but it also contains shortcuts for launching scripts from the packages. See some examples:

```bash
# Build only monaco-languageclient
npm run build:client
# Build only vscode-ws-jsonrpc
npm run build:vscode-ws-jsonrpc
# Build main examples
npm run build:example:main
```

## Examples

There are a couple of different examples that demonstrate how the `monaco-languageclient` can be used :

- The **server** example located in [./packages/examples/main/src/server](./packages/examples/main/src/server) runs a Node.js [Express app](./packages/examples/main/src/server/main.ts) where web sockets are used to enable communication between the language server process and the client web application. The language server can be started as internal or external process.

- The **client** example located in [./packages/examples/main/src/client](./packages/examples/main/src/client) contains the [client web app](./packages/examples/main/src/client/main.ts) which connects to the language server therefore requires the node server app to be run in parallel.

- The **langium-web-worker-language-server** example located in [./packages/examples/main/src/langium](./packages/examples/main/src/langium) contains both the [language client](./packages/examples/main/src/langium/main.ts) and the [langauge server implementation running in a web worker](https://github.com/langium/langium/blob/main/examples/statemachine/src/language-server/main-browser.ts). They communicate via `vscode-languageserver-protocol/browser` instead of a web socket used in the **server/client** examples.

- The **browser** example located in [./packages/examples/main/src/browser](./packages/examples/main/src/browser) demonstrates how a [language service written in JavaScript](./packages/examples/main/src/browser/main.ts) can be used in a Monaco Editor contained in a simple HTML page. This example can now be considered legacy as the web worker option eases client side language server implementation and separation.

- The **react-client** example located in [./packages/examples/main/src/react](./packages/examples/main/src/react) contains the [React client](./packages/examples/main/src/react/main.tsx). It does the same as the regular client example but inside a React Functional Component.

- The **angular-client** example is now found in [its own repository](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient-ng-example.git)

**Hint:** Most client examples now share [common code](./packages/examples/main/src/common.ts) to reduce the amount of redundant code.

## Verification

- The **webpack** verification example located in [./packages/verify/webpack](./packages/verify/webpack) demonstrates how bundling can be achieved with webpack. You find the configuration here: [webpack.config.js](./packages/verify/webpack/webpack.config.js).

- The **vite** verification example located in [./packages/verify/vite](./packages/verify/vite) demonstrates how bundling can be achieved with vite. There is no configuration required.

## Example usage

Start the Vite dev server. It is assumed you ran the build as described in [Getting Started](#getting-started):

```shell
npm run dev
```

Vite serves all client code at [localhost](http://localhost:8080). You can go to the [index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html) and navigate to all client examples from there. You can edit the client example code directly (TypeScript) and Vite ensures it automatically made available.

If you want to change the libries and see this reflected directly, then you need to run the watch command that compiles all TypeScript files form both libraries and the examples:

```shell
npm run watch
```

For the **client** or the **client-webpack** examples you need to ensure the **server** example is running:

```shell
# start the express server with the language server running in the same process.
npm run start:example:server
# alternative: start the express server with language server running in the external process.
npm run start:example:server:ext
```

For everything else Vite is sufficient. If you want to reach the verification examples from the vite dev server index page you need to run the following additional http-servers beforehand (this is also indicated on the page itself):

```shell
# Serve the webpack verification example on http://localhost:8081
npm run start:verify:webpack
# Serve the vite verification example on http://localhost:8082
npm run start:verify:vite
```

## VSCode integration

You can as well run [vscode tasks](./.vscode/launch.json) to start and debug the server in different modes and the client.

## Troubleshooting

### General

If you use **monaco-languageclient** make sure you have a version of **monaco-editor** installed in your project that is compliant with **monaco-languageclient** and its peer dependency [monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api).

Ensure **monaco-editor** and **monaco-languageclient** are imported before you do any **monaco-editor** intialization. This ensures `monaco` and `vscode` (from **monaco-vscode-api**) are imported beforehand. This is for example done like this in all examples contained in this repository.

### Volta

There are [Volta](https://volta.sh/) instructions in the `package.json` files. When you have Volta available it will ensure the exactly specified `node` and `npm` versions are used.

### monaco-editor-core

Originally **monaco-languageclient** was dependent on **monaco-editor-core**, but we changed this with version **1.0.0**. If your project requires to use **monaco-editor-core** and you want to stay compatible with **1.0.0** of **monaco-languageclient** you can install **monaco-editor-core** as **monaco-editor**:

```shell
npm install monaco-editor@npm:monaco-editor-core
```

Or if you are using **Webpack** you can alternatively add this alias to its config:

```javascript
resolve: {
  alias: {
    // This doesn't pull any languages into bundles and works as monaco-editor-core was installed
    'monaco-editor$': 'monaco-editor-core$',
    'monaco-editor/': 'monaco-editor-core/',
  }
}
```

If you use **monaco-editor** as dependency, but only want to have the content of **monaco-editor-core** than just only import:

```javascript
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/edcore.main.js';
```

Especially, if you are using your own language server or define your own language it may be a good idea to only import the core of monaco-editor

### @monaco-editor/react

Add the **monaco-editor** import at the top of your editor component file [source](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react#use-monaco-editor-as-an-npm-package):

```javascript
import * as monaco from "monaco-editor";
import { loader } from "@monaco-editor/react";

loader.config({ monaco });
```

### pnpm

If you use pnpm, you have to add `vscode` / `monaco-vscode-api` as direct dependency (see the [following table](#monaco-editor--monaco-vscode-api-compatibility-table)), otherwise the installation will fail.

```json
"vscode": "npm:@codingame/monaco-vscode-api@~1.78.8"
```
